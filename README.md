## Maxwell Cannon

**Lost the thread** - 9 days in and am doing okay. It's tough to keep up with every puzzle, but I'll return to Days 3(2), 5, 7, and 8

**12/2/2023** - *time* - Day 2 Complete - Total Time: 27:56
> Today was a tough start but pretty easy concept. Part 2 was super easy once I had the framework for part 1. I feel like I'm getting warmed up. Usually day 3 is when it hits me though.

**12/1/2023** - *11:58pm* - Day2 prep work

**12/1/2023** - *12:38am* - Day 1 Complete - Total Time: 34:18  
> Reflections - Pretty easy. Knocking the rust off, but got it wrapped up  


**11/30/2023** - *10:30pm* - Creating Github repo and prepping for the first day of AOC23
